## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow
```
User clicks theme button in navbar
    ↓
Dropdown shows all 5 themes
    ↓
User selects preferred theme
    ↓
ThemeContext updates CSS variables
    ↓
All colors smoothly transition (0.3s)
    ↓
Choice saved to localStorage
    ↓
Theme persists on next visit
```

### Technical Flow
```javascript
// 1. Theme Context provides state
const { theme, setTheme, themes } = useTheme()

// 2. When theme changes, CSS vars update
root.style.setProperty('--bg', themeColors.bg)
root.style.setProperty('--text', themeColors.text)
// ... all other variables

// 3. All components use CSS variables
background: var(--bg);
color: var(--text);
border-color: var(--border);
```
